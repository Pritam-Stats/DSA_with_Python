# Foundation

This folder contains fundamental programming building blocks that strengthen core problem-solving ability before advanced DSA topics.

These problems are not primarily interview-focused.
They exist to improve control over logic, loops, recursion, and mathematical reasoning.

---

## Purpose of This Section

* Strengthen control over loops and conditionals
* Improve mathematical thinking
* Build comfort with recursion
* Develop number manipulation skills
* Master bit-level reasoning
* Improve implementation accuracy

Foundation work supports advanced data structures and algorithmic problem solving.
