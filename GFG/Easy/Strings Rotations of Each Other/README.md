# GFG20 Check if Strings are Rotations of Each Other

## ðŸ§  Problem Summary

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length, check if `s2` is a rotation of `s1`.  
Rotation means shifting characters from one end to the other (left or right).

## âœ… Approach

If `s2` is a rotation of `s1`, it will always be a **substring of `s1 + s1`**.  
Also, both strings must have the same length.

## ðŸ§ª Example



> This was the easiest problem I solved till date but the only thing this type of easy problem demands is the ability and experience to understand the problem statement, if we understand the problem summary what it's asking us to do in simplest terms we can solve as quickly as expected.
